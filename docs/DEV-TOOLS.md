# Dev Tools

Development-only tools and routes for testing and debugging. Automatically enabled in development mode and disabled in production.

## Configuration

Development tools are controlled by the `DEV_TOOLS_ENABLED` environment variable (default: `true` in development, `false` in production).

Routes are only registered when `devTools.enabled` is `true` **and** `NODE_ENV !== 'production'` **and** `ENVIRONMENT=local` (see `isDevToolsEnabled()` in `src/server/common/helpers/dev-tools-enabled.js`).

Implementation lives in `src/server/dev-tools/` and is only registered when all of the above conditions are met.

## Available Dev Routes

All development routes are prefixed with `/dev/`:

### Demo Confirmation Pages

**Route:** `/dev/demo-confirmation/{form-slug}`

Preview confirmation pages with mock data for any form in the system. Useful for:

- Testing confirmation page templates
- Validating dynamic content insertion
- Previewing new grant confirmation pages

**Example:** `http://localhost:3000/dev/demo-confirmation/example-grant-with-auth`

When running in development mode, the demo confirmation handler:

- Shows warning messages when no confirmation config is found
- Provides fallback demonstration content
- Displays form metadata (title, slug, ID) for debugging
- Includes error details when configuration issues occur
- Uses mock data for testing dynamic content insertion

### Demo Details Pages

**Route:** `GET /dev/demo-details/{form-slug}`, `POST /dev/demo-details/{form-slug}`

Preview the config-driven details (check-details) page with mock mapped data for any form whose definition configures `metadata.detailsPage.displaySections`.

**Example:** `http://localhost:3000/dev/demo-details/example-grant-with-auth`

Submitting "No" (details not correct) shows the incorrect-details page; submitting "Yes" redirects to the form's start page.

### Demo Print Application Pages

**Route:** `/dev/demo-print-application/{form-slug}`

Preview the print submitted application page with auto-generated mock answers for any form in the system.

**Example:** `http://localhost:3000/dev/demo-print-application/example-grant-with-auth`

### Error Page Testing

Test error page rendering at the following routes:

| Route           | Error Code | Description           |
| --------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| `/dev/test-400` | 400        | Bad Request           |
| `/dev/test-401` | 401        | Unauthorized          |
| `/dev/test-403` | 403        | Forbidden             |
| `/dev/test-404` | 404        | Not Found             |
| `/dev/test-429` | 429        | Too Many Requests     |
| `/dev/test-500` | 500        | Internal Server Error |
| `/dev/test-503` | 503        | Service Unavailable   |

These routes trigger the corresponding HTTP errors to verify error page templates render correctly.

```

## Local config & form-definition overrides

The `gt up` flow runs `tools/setup-local-config.sh` first, which rebuilds `compose/config-broker-local` by pulling the `DEFRA/grants-config-*` repos from GitHub.

### Offline-safe config pull

The config tree is built into a temporary staging folder and only swapped into `config-broker-local` after a **fully successful** pull. If GitHub is unreachable (e.g. you're offline), the staging folder is discarded and the existing `config-broker-local` folder is left untouched as a working "cached" copy. As long as that folder already holds config files, the script prints a clear "keeping existing cached config … continuing offline" message and exits **successfully**, so `up` completes and the config broker keeps working without internet. Only when there is no cached config to fall back to (the folder is missing or empty — typically a first run that has never pulled) does the script exit non-zero with a useful error explaining that an internet connection is required to download the config at least once.

### Skip re-downloading when already at the latest version

Each grant is stored under a version-named folder (e.g. `grasslands@0.4.0`), so the existing `config-broker-local` folder itself tells the script which versions are already present. On each run the script resolves every `DEFRA/grants-config-*` repo's latest tag (a cheap API call), then for each config file reuses the cached copy when `<grant>@<version>/<service>/<file>` already exists on disk, downloading only what is missing. So when a repo's latest tag is unchanged nothing is re-downloaded, and a new/changed version (or an empty cache, or a missing grant folder) is pulled fresh automatically.

### Local form-definition overrides

For editing and testing a WIP grant's **form definition** (not yet ready to push to the config repo), the `gt` TUI `local` menu lets you toggle per-grant overrides sourced from an in-repo folder (`compose/config-broker/local-form-definitions/`) or a sibling `grants-config-*` checkout, then publishes the selection to grants-ui-backend as a bumped version that the frontend serves immediately.

See [Local form-definition overrides](DOCKER.md#local-form-definition-overrides) in the Docker docs for the full mechanism — discovery sources, version-bump behaviour, the refresh/disable flow, and `GRANTS_UI_SIBLING_CONFIG_DIR`.

## Inspect application state

Inspect the application state persisted in the local Grants UI Backend database:

```bash
gt state example-grant-with-auth --sbi 106238911
```

Use `--grant-version <version>` to select an exact grant version, or `--json` for machine-readable output. Without
`--grant-version`, every matching version is shown newest first. This command is read-only and requires the local
Docker stack to be running.

## Journey Runner

Automates clicking through grant application forms in the browser. Useful for quickly reaching a specific page during development without manually filling in every field.

### How it works

1. A Hapi plugin (`journey-runner-plugin.js`) serves a script at `/dev/journey-runner/{journey}.js`
2. The page layout template (`page.njk`) includes this script on every page
3. The script reads a JSON journey definition, matches the current page URL to a step, fills in the form fields, submits, repeating on each page load until it reaches the target step

### Usage

Navigate to the grant's normal start page (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/example-grant-with-auth/start`), not a `/dev/` route. The journey runner script is automatically loaded on every page via the layout template.

Open the browser console and run:

```js
runJourney() // Run through all steps
runJourney(5) // Stop before step 5
runJourney('sectionName') // Run only the named section
runJourney(null, { parcel: 'SD6843-7039' }) // Drive the mapParcel step to a specific parcel
runJourney(null, { commonLand: true }) // Answer a common-land yesNo step "Yes" instead of its own value
stopJourney() // Cancel a running journey
```

Sections allow you to complete one task list section at a time. The section name must match the `section` property in the journey JSON steps.

### Run from the CLI

The same journeys can be driven headlessly from the terminal with `gt journey <slug>`, without opening a browser or the devtools console:

```sh
gt journey woodland                                   # walk the whole journey headlessly
gt journey example-grant-with-auth --stop 8           # stop before step 8
gt journey woodland --stop eligibility                # run only the "eligibility" section
gt journey example-grant-with-auth --headed           # watch a real browser drive it
gt journey woodland --common-land yes                 # walk the common-land guidance + confirmation branch
```

#### Or pick from the interactive menu

Prefer not to remember slugs and flags? Run `gt` with no arguments to open the interactive TUI, then choose **`journey ⇢`** from the main menu. It walks you through the same options as prompts — no flags needed:

1. **Journey** — pick from the discovered journey definitions (each annotated with the CRN it uses, or a ⚠ warning if it can't complete on a standard local stack).
2. **CRN** — only asked when a journey has more than one known-good CRN (e.g. woodland); otherwise the right CRN is chosen automatically.
3. **Headed or headless** — headless runs in the background (bundled Chromium); headed watches it in your installed Google Chrome.
4. **Clear state?** — keep the saved application state (resume where it left off) or reset to step 1, matching the footer "Clear application state" link.
5. **Common land or shared grazing?** — only asked for journeys with a `yesNo` step that supports it (currently woodland): **Yes** shows the guidance page and adds the "What you need to do" section to the confirmation page; **No** is the standard journey with only the default confirmation content — so either branch is reachable without editing the journey file.
6. **Run '\<journey\>' how?** — one combined menu: **Run to the end** (default), **Window closed** (see [below](#application-window-closed)), **Mock no eligible actions** for journeys with a map step (see [below](#land-parcels-with-no-eligible-actions)), or — headed runs only — halt the browser on a chosen page for inspection.

Journeys flagged as won't-complete (e.g. **farm-payments**, **methane**) make you acknowledge why before running. The `journey ⇢` item is disabled until the Docker stack is up; for a plain `npm run dev` server use the `gt journey <slug>` form above instead.

Under the hood this launches a Chromium browser (reusing the acceptance suite's Playwright install in `acceptance/`), signs in through the DefraID stub, then calls `runJourney()` on the page and streams the `[journey-runner]` console output to your terminal. It exits non-zero if the journey gets stuck, and prints the final page heading and any error summary to help diagnose the stall.

| Flag                      | Default                           | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--parcel <ref>`          | first available parcel            | Land parcel the `mapParcel` step selects, e.g. `SD6843-7039`. Overrides the step's `value` without editing the journey file. The ref must be one `/api/map/parcels` returns, or the step fails listing what was available.                                                                           |
| `--common-land <yes\|no>` | step's own `value` (woodland: no) | Answers a `yesNo` step whose `overrideKey` is `commonLand` this way instead of its hardcoded `value` — e.g. `woodland`'s grazing-rights question, to reach the common-land guidance page and the confirmation page's extra section.                                                                  |
| `--mock-no-actions`       | off                               | Makes land parcels report **no eligible actions**, so the map page's "There are no eligible actions for this parcel" error can be reached. See [Land parcels with no eligible actions](#land-parcels-with-no-eligible-actions) below.                                                                |
| `--mock-window-closed`    | off                               | Makes the app report the grant's **application window as closed**, redirecting to the interruption page. See [Application window closed](#application-window-closed) below.                                                                                                                          |
| `--crn <crn>`             | journey's allowlisted CRN         | DefraID CRN to sign in as. Defaults per journey to a CRN on that grant's allowlist — most grants are `allowAll` (uses `1102838829`), but **woodland** needs `1100943757`/`1100943838`, and **farm-payments** uses `1102838829`. The interactive menu lets you pick when a journey has more than one. |
| `--stop <n\|sect>`        | run to the end                    | Stop before step `n` (1-indexed), or run only section `sect`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `--headed`                | headless                          | Watch the run in your installed Google Chrome (headless uses bundled Chromium)                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `--clear`                 | keeps state                       | Flush saved application state first, so `--stop` starts from step 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `--base-url <url>`        | auto-detected                     | App base URL — defaults to `https://localhost:4000` when the HA addon is running, otherwise `http://localhost:3000`                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `--skip-install`          | installs chromium                 | Skip `playwright install chromium`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The app must already be running (`gt up` or `npm run dev`), and the same land-grants/mockserver setup described below is needed for journeys that reach `/select-land-parcel` or `/total-area-of-woodland`. The stub password comes from `DEFRA_ID_USER_PASSWORD` (defaults to `x`, matching `acceptance/run-local.sh`).

The base URL is auto-detected from the running stack: `http://localhost:3000` normally, or `https://localhost:4000` when the **High Availability** addon (`gt up --ha`) fronts the app with its HTTPS nginx proxy (the self-signed cert is accepted automatically). Override with `--base-url` for a non-standard setup.

The journey must be allowlisted for the signed-in user, or the app redirects to `/auth/journey-unauthorised` and the run reports as stuck. Locally the allowlist lives in the `config__allowlist_entries` collection in the `grants-ui-backend` Mongo database; `example-grant-with-auth` is seeded `allowAll`, so it's the most reliable journey to smoke-test with.

### Land parcels with no eligible actions

The Grasslands map page rejects Continue when the selected parcel has no eligible action, showing:

> There are no eligible actions for this parcel. Change the parcel land cover or choose a different parcel to view eligible actions.

The wording deliberately matches the select-actions page's own empty state (`src/server/land-grants/views/select-actions.html`) — one condition, one message, whichever page the user reaches first.

**That state _is_ reachable from local data, on the right CRN.** CRN `1103313150` owns parcels `SK0972-6811` and `SK0972-7313`, which sit on land cover classes (551 and 332) that no action maps to. Every enabled action comes back with `availability.value: 0`, and the parcel is rejected:

```sh
gt journey grasslands --crn 1103313150 --parcel SK0972-6811
```

That CRN is offered in the TUI's journey picker for grasslands, and `--crn` overrides it from the command line. Pass the parcel in its **hyphenated** form (`SK0972-6811`, not `SK0972 6811`) — the runner matches the ids the map API returns.

Note the shape of the data, because it is easy to get wrong: the action list comes back **non-empty** and it is the availability that is zero. A guard counting returned actions rather than claimable ones misses this entirely. `acceptance/test/features/action-selection.feature` covers both parcels against the seeded API, and is the real regression guard for the detection logic.

The mock below is still useful for forcing the state on _any_ parcel and any CRN, without depending on what the seed happens to contain. It short-circuits `findParcelsWithNoActions` before the API call, so it exercises the error rendering only — never the detection:

```sh
gt journey grasslands --mock-no-actions --headed    # or pick "Mock no eligible actions" in the TUI
```

It sets a `dev_mock_no_actions=1` cookie, which `MapSelectPageController` honours by treating every selected parcel as having no eligible actions. Because it is request-scoped it needs no restart and works on either land-grants stack. It is read through `isNoActionsMockEnabled()` (`src/server/common/helpers/mock-overrides.js`), which returns `false` whenever `devTools.enabled` is off — so the cookie is inert in a deployed environment.

The run is _expected_ to stop on `/select-land-parcel`; the driver prints the error summary and exits non-zero, which is the check.

To poke at it by hand, set the cookie in devtools and click Continue. It is a session cookie and nothing in the app clears it, so unset it when you're done or every later local run will show the error:

```js
document.cookie = 'dev_mock_no_actions=1' // on
document.cookie = 'dev_mock_no_actions=; Max-Age=0; path=/' // off
```

The `gt journey --mock-no-actions` path needs no cleanup — it sets the cookie on a throwaway Playwright context that is discarded when the run ends.

### Application window closed

A grant's `metadata.isApplicationWindowOpen: false` redirects new/draft applicants to the "Application window closed" page (existing applications with a submitted status are unaffected). Testing that for real means editing a grant's config-broker YAML fixture and bumping its version to dodge the local config-broker's re-pull-on-`docker:up` caching — awkward for a quick check.

```sh
gt journey example-grant-with-auth --mock-window-closed --headed    # or pick "Window closed" in the TUI
```

This sets a `dev_mock_window_closed=1` cookie, honoured by `applicationWindowClosedRedirect` and `serviceRootRedirect` (`src/server/common/request-pipeline/redirects/`) as if the grant's metadata had the window closed, regardless of what the grant is actually configured with. It's read through `isWindowClosedMockEnabled()` (`src/server/common/helpers/mock-overrides.js`), which returns `false` whenever `devTools.enabled` is off — so the cookie is inert in a deployed environment.

The run is _expected_ to stop immediately on `/{slug}/application-window-closed`; the driver reports it as stuck there, which is the check.

To poke at it by hand:

```js
document.cookie = 'dev_mock_window_closed=1' // on
document.cookie = 'dev_mock_window_closed=; Max-Age=0; path=/' // off
```

The `gt journey --mock-window-closed` path needs no cleanup — same throwaway-context mechanism as `--mock-no-actions` above.

### Adding a new journey

Create a JSON file in `journey-runner/journeys/` named after the grant's URL slug (e.g. `example-grant-with-map.json`).

`journeys.test.js` checks each journey against the grant's form definition in `compose/config-broker-local/`: every step must point at a page the definition has, and no unconditional page may sit between two steps the journey does cover. It skips itself when the local config-broker sync has not been run. Both checks matter because the runner reports an unmatched page as `journey complete`, which `gt journey` counts as success — a journey that silently stops halfway still exits zero.

The file is an array of step objects, executed in order:

```json
[
  { "slug": "start", "name": "Start", "type": "submitOnly" },
  { "slug": "are-you-eligible", "name": "Eligibility", "type": "yesNo", "fieldName": "isEligible" }
]
```

Each step requires:

| Field       | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `slug`      | Yes      | The page URL slug to match against                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `name`      | Yes      | Human-readable label (for console logs)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Grants without a journey definition: `example-grant-with-task-list-hide-questions` and `example-whitelist`, both covered by the acceptance suite instead (`task-list-hide-questions.feature`, `allowlist.feature`).

> **example-grant-with-map note:** the shortest end-to-end exercise of `MapSelectPageController` → `SelectActionsPageController` → `ConfirmLandAndActionsPageController`. Like grasslands it takes the first of the grant's enabled actions (`CLIG3`, `SCR2`, `CSAM3`), so it needs mockserver in front of the land-grants API. It has no `/declaration` — submitting `/summary` (`MapSubmissionPageController`) goes straight to `/confirmation`.

> **methane note:** this journey cannot complete locally. methane is a frontend-code-only grant with no config-broker entry, so the backend allowlist turns every CRN away at `/auth/journey-unauthorised`. Onboarding methane to the config broker (or teaching the allowlist to skip code-only grants) would fix it; seeding `config__allowlist_entries` will not. `gt journey methane` makes you acknowledge this before running.

> **grasslands note:** it runs end-to-end on the standard local stack (`gt up`, mockserver in front of the land-grants API). The journey enters at `/check-details`, picks a parcel on the map with the `mapParcel` step, and takes the first of the grant's enabled actions (`CLIG3`, `CSAM3`, `SCR2`) — those codes are in `mockserver/expectations.json`, so removing them there will strand the run on `/select-actions-for-land-parcel`.

> **farm-payments note:** the journey enters at `/confirm-farm-details` (this grant has no `/start` page) and runs cleanly up to `/select-actions-for-land-parcel`. Completing `select-actions` needs a land parcel that the land-grants backend accepts for the offered actions — the seeded actions are moorland-only (`CMOR1`, `UPL1`–`UPL3`), so a **majority-moorland parcel** is required. If the local land-grants seed has no moorland parcel, every parcel is rejected with _"This parcel is not majority on the moorland"_ and the runner stops there. That is a backend seed-data condition, not a journey-spec problem. Once such a parcel exists, add its ID as the `value` on the `select-land-parcel` step to target it.

### Example grant with auth

The `example-grant-with-auth` journey is the canonical demo of every form component. Use the step numbers below with `runJourney(N)` to stop on a specific page. For example, `runJourney(8)` fills in and submits steps 1–7, then lands on the `number-field-validation` page without filling it in. Handy when iterating on a single component.

There are two `NumberField` demos because the engine treats validation and conditional routing as separate concerns: step 8 (`/number-field-validation`) demonstrates schema-level `min`/`max` rejection (you cannot leave the page until the value is in range), while step 9 (`/number-field-routing`) demonstrates an `is more than` condition that diverts the journey when the value exceeds £100,000 (the value is accepted; only the next page changes).

Steps 20 and 21 traverse a `RepeatPageController`: the engine renders one URL per item (`/repeat-page/{itemId}`, where `{itemId}` is a UUID) plus a list-summary URL (`/repeat-page/summary`), so the runner needs two steps — the first uses `matchMode: "prefix"` to match the per-item URL by UUID, the second uses the literal slug `"repeat-page/summary"` to match the summary URL exactly. See the `matchMode` row above.

Step 17 (`/location-components`) groups five location field types on a single page (`EastingNorthingField`, `OsGridRefField`, `NationalGridFieldNumberField`, `LatLongField`, `GeospatialField`); the runner submits valid values for all five (the `GeospatialField` textarea is filled with a single-feature GeoJSON example). Step 18 (`/hidden-field`) demonstrates a `HiddenField` rendered with no visible input — the runner just submits the page.

A few pages are reached only when their conditions match and are skipped by `runJourney()` during a normal traversal. Each one demonstrates a different condition operator:

| Page                    | Operator       | Value type     | Trigger                                                                | Runner default    |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `/terminal-page`        | `is`           | `BooleanValue` | Answer "No" on `/yes-no-field`                                         | "Yes"             |
| `/number-too-high`      | `is more than` | `NumberValue`  | Enter any value over £100,000 on `/number-field-routing` (e.g. 200000) | £50,000           |
| `/checkboxes-follow-up` | `contains`     | `ListItemRef`  | Tick "Option three" on `/checkboxes-field`                             | First option only |

To exercise these pages, run `runJourney(N)` to land on the trigger page (`runJourney(3)` for terminal, `runJourney(9)` for number routing, `runJourney(7)` for checkboxes), then enter a triggering value manually and submit.

#### Environment setup for `runJourney()` to reach `/declaration`

Step 22 (`/select-land-parcel`) is a `MapSelectPageController` page. It renders parcels fetched from the DAL stub for the signed-in SBI via the `/api/map/parcels` endpoint (`fetchParcels` → `fetchParcelsFromDal`), so the map is inherently scoped to that user — there is no separate auth check on submit for this page. For the journey runner to clear the page, three things have to line up — the same conditions that the woodland journey relies on:

1. **Sign in with CRN `1102838829`.** The DAL stub (`grants-ui-dal-stub`) returns parcels for this CRN; signing in with another CRN renders no selectable parcels on the map.
2. **Run with mockserver in front of the land-grants API.** The default `compose.grants-ui.yml` already points `LAND_GRANTS_API_URL` at mockserver. If you're running `compose.land-grants.yml` (real backend), layer in `compose.journey-runner.yml`:

   ```sh
   npm run docker:landgrants:journey-runner:up
   # tear down with: npm run docker:landgrants:journey-runner:down
   ```

3. **Clear stale state between runs.** Visit `http://localhost:3000/example-grant-with-auth/clear-application-state` to flush both the Redis-backed form state and the in-memory parcel cache.

The `select-land-parcel` step in `example-grant-with-auth.json` is a `mapParcel` step with `"selectAll": true`, so the runner fetches every parcel ID from `/api/map/parcels` and writes them all as hidden `landParcels` inputs before submitting — the map equivalent of the `land-parcels` step in `woodland.json`, which ticks every parcel checkbox on that checkbox-based page.

If `runJourney()` reports `Stuck on "SelectLandParcel (map)"`, the most likely cause is the signed-in CRN. Re-check step 1, hit the clear-state route in step 3, and re-run.

### Woodland Management Plan

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/woodland/check-details` (woodland's first page — it has no `/start`) and open the browser console.

Sign in with CRN `1100943757` (or `1100943838`) — woodland's allowlist only admits these CRNs, **not** `1102838829`. (`gt journey woodland` picks the right CRN automatically.)

The `total-area-of-woodland` page POSTs to the land-grants-api `/api/v1/wmp/validate` endpoint. To keep the journey runner reliable regardless of which compose stack is running, point `LAND_GRANTS_API_URL` at mockserver — which has a mock success response in `mockserver/expectations.json`. If you're running with `compose.land-grants.yml` (real backend), layer in `compose.journey-runner.yml` to override the URL back to mockserver:

```sh
npm run docker:landgrants:journey-runner:up
# tear down with: npm run docker:landgrants:journey-runner:down
```

Without `compose.land-grants.yml`, the default in `compose.grants-ui.yml` already points at mockserver, so no override is needed.

If you change `mockserver/expectations.json` mid-session and the journey still shows the old values:

1. `docker compose restart mockserver` — reload expectations
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/woodland/clear-application-state` — flushes Redis session state and the in-memory parcel cache in one hit
3. Re-run `runJourney()` from `/woodland/check-details`

A full grants-ui restart is _not_ needed thanks to step 2.

```js
// Run from /woodland/check-details or /woodland/tasks
runJourney() // Run all remaining sections from the current page

// Run from /woodland/tasks
runJourney('eligibility') // Complete the eligibility section
runJourney('about-woodland') // Complete the about your woodland section
runJourney('check-and-submit') // Summary, potential funding and declaration
```

Available sections:

| Section            | Description                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `eligibility`      | Eligibility questions (land, tenancy, WMP, etc.) |
| `about-woodland`   | Woodland details (area, grid ref, FC team)       |
| `check-and-submit` | Summary, potential funding and declaration       |
